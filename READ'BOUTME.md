- 👋 Hi, I’m @SvOTM. You may call me "Rod". Not rod like a "fish rod", but yes, Rod will do fine :D

- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming (not just playing, but also developing videogames. My favorite genre would be, without doubt, RPG; also enjoy action-adventure and
metroid-vania-like games, and even more if all of them are mixed o.o Also fast-paced card games like "Munchkin" and almost every boargame), writing, 
outdoor activities, photography and a lot of other things that I'm not putting here.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Gettin' into game develpment stuff on my own. Found on the internet nice courses about developing games and coding that I would like to dom
yet I need to create the discipline and consistency to complete them and do all the other things I want to do D:

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any videogame project that would give me experience on the field (I'm nice at giving people fun experiences within
the mechanics of the games. Also I can do some translation (English ot Spanish and viceversa). More than just video-games ;)

- 📫 How to reach me ... Let's get to know eachother, may be play somthing together. Mail me here: svlj@protonmail.com (not social networks for now :c)

Thank you for reading :D Have a nice day! :DDD
